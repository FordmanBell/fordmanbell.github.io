title: SWPM Dupe - Replicating Bloomberg's Swap Pricer with QuantLib
---

To familiarize myself with the QuantLib library, and also to create an essential building block that can later be used by other analyses, I've written some code to 1.construct a SOFR curve given published swap rates, and 2.use the curve to price different SOFR swaps. To make sure that this pricer is actually useful, I also verify that the output aligns (almost) perfectly with the gold standard in financial data - Bloomberg Terminal.

Before diving into the pricer, I want to emphasis the importance of data quality in finance, especially rates. This is because even 1bp can be the difference between a good  and a great bonus for a junior analyst (100m * 0.0001 = 10k). Furthermore, it's very easy to make mistakes in rates, since all the day-count, calendar, and settlement conventions can easily skew your calculations by more than 1bp. Fortunately, my pricer's results align with Bloomberg's to a high degree of precision, with the worst difference being less than 0.2bps.

I also want to give credit to this [site](https://rateslib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/z_swpm.html){:target="_blank"} outlining a rateslib-based SWPM replication, which this post takes inspiration from.

To start, we retrieve the SOFR swap rates data from Bloomberg and record it. On 08/17/2023, the swap curve is as follows:

Given the swap rates, we first need to find out the exact termination dates for each of these rates. Note that since it's swaps, we cannot just add the term to the current date. First, we need to increase it by 2 business days to arrive at the settlement date (08/21/2023). Then, after we add the tenor, we also need to increase the date if it doesn't fall on a business day (the "Following" convention). The resulting termination dates are below:

Then, we create some helpers for constructing the SOFR yield curve. Note that we're using a 2-day payment lag after accrual periods, per convention. We also need a SOFR index object for the rater helpers.

```
# SOFR Index Object
sofr_index = ql.OvernightIndex(
    "SOFR", 
    0, 
    ql.USDCurrency(), 
    calendar, 
    day_count
)

# SOFR swap helpers for bootstrapping the curve
helpers = []

for _, row in data.iterrows():
    helper = ql.OISRateHelper(
        settlement,
        ql.Period(row['Termination'] - settle_date, ql.Days),
        ql.QuoteHandle(ql.SimpleQuote(row['Rate']/100)),
        sofr_index,
        paymentLag=2,
        paymentConvention=convention,
        paymentFrequency=frequency,
        paymentCalendar=calendar,
    )
    helpers.append(helper)

```

With the helpers constructed, we can now create a yield curve object. QuantLib's PiecewiseLogLinearDiscount curve corresponds to the "Step Forward (Cont)" method used by Bloomberg.

```
curve = ql.PiecewiseLogLinearDiscount(today, helpers, day_count)
```

Retrieving our curve's discount factors (DFs) for the termination dates above, we see that all the values except the 4-year DF are identical to Bloomberg's up to 6 decimals, and the 4-year DFs differ by 0.000012

We are ready to price a swap. As an example, here is a swap for pricing:

- Effective Date: 11/21/2023
- Termination Date: 2/21/2025
- Notional: $100m
- Type: Receive Fixed
- Coupon: 5.4%
- Fixed Leg Frequency: Annual, Act/360
- Floating Leg Frequency: Annual, Act/360
- Index: SOFR OIS

To create the swap, we make a payment schedule, create a new SOFR index based on our curve, and use those to create a new swap object. We can then use our new curve to calculate the NPV and the par rate of this swap.

```
# Accrual schedule for swap
fixed_schedule = ql.Schedule(
    effective, 
    termination, 
    ql.Period(frequency),
    calendar,
    convention,
    convention,
    ql.DateGeneration.Backward,
    False
)

# Create sofr index object with the fitted sofr curve
sofr_index = ql.OvernightIndex(
    "SOFR", 0, ql.USDCurrency(), calendar, day_count, ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(curve)
)

# Create swap
def create_swap(rate, engine):
    swap = ql.OvernightIndexedSwap(
        swap_type,
        notional,
        fixed_schedule,
        rate,
        day_count,
        sofr_index,
        spread,
        payment_lag,
        convention
    )
    swap.setPricingEngine(engine)
    return swap

engine = ql.DiscountingSwapEngine(ql.YieldTermStructureHandle(curve))
swap = create_swap(fixed_rate, engine)

par_coup = round(swap.fairRate() * 100, 6)
npv = round(swap.NPV(), 2)
```

We can also calculate the DV01, gamma, and PV01 of our swap. A good approximation for DV01 and gamma are, respectively, (P<sub>d</sub> - P<sub>u</sub>) / 2 and (P<sub>d</sub> + P<sub>u</sub> - 2P) / (0.0001 ^ 2), where P is the NPV of our swap, P<sub>d</sub> is the price of our swap given a 1bp decrease in the swap rates used to construct our curve, and P<sub>u</sub> is the price of our swap given a 1bp increase in the rates. To match Bloomberg's gamma, we also normalize our gamma by the notional. To calculate PV01, we have (V<sub>u</sub> - V<sub>d</sub>) / 2, where V<sub>u</sub> and V<sub>d</sub> are the values of our swap given a 1bp increase and decrease in the fixed coupon, respectively. 

The results from our pricer look promising, as they are almost identical to the Bloomberg results.

Lastly, we calculate the cashflows of the swap and compare them to Bloomberg's.

The results show that all the cashflow differences are less than $1. No bonuses will be lost today.

This wraps up the construction of our pricer. Potential next steps include visualizing the yield curve, calculating carry and rolldown, and building a GUI. Since I couldn't find any existing examples online that use QuantLib to closely replicate Bloomberg for SOFR instruments, I hope this project serves as a helpful starting point for others exploring the library.
